# Teamder Project
<h2> What is Teamder?</h2>
<p>Teamder is a Full-stack interactive web application deployed to Heroku, made in order to satisfy the needs of those who are willing to find new teammates. There is a live map and a calendar with the current posted activities and the weather so, once you are signed up to the database, you will be able to invite and join other people to do some outdoor excercise.</p>

<h3>Technologies we worked with</h3>
<p>React.Js, Flux, Python, Flask, SQLAlchemy, Geocoding API, OpenWeatherMap, Heroku</p>

### Back-End Manual Installation:

It is recomended to install the backend first, make sure you have Python 3.8, Pipenv and a database engine (Posgress recomended)

1. Install the python packages: `$ pipenv install`
2. Create a .env file based on the .env.example: `$ cp .env.example .env`
3. Install your database engine and create your database, depending on your database you have to create a DATABASE_URL variable with one of the possible values, make sure yo replace the valudes with your database information:

| Engine    | DATABASE_URL                                        |
| --------- | --------------------------------------------------- |
| SQLite    | sqlite:////test.db                                  |
| MySQL     | mysql://username:password@localhost:port/example    |
| Postgress | postgres://username:password@localhost:5432/example |

4. Migrate the migrations: `$ pipenv run migrate` (skip if you have not made changes to the models on the `./src/api/models.py`)
5. Run the migrations: `$ pipenv run upgrade`
6. Run the application: `$ pipenv run start`

### Backend Populate Table Users

To insert test users in the database execute the following command:

```sh
$ flask insert-test-users 5
```

And you will see the following message:

```
